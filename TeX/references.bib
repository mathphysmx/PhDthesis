	abstract = {After a general analysis regarding the concept of coal {\textquotedblleft}cleat system{\textquotedblright}, its genetic origin and practical applications to coalbed methane (CBM) commercial production and to CO2 geological sequestration projects, the authors have developed a method to answer, quickly and accurately in accordance with the industrial practice and needs, the following yet unanswered questions: (1) how to define the spatial orientation of the different classes of cleats presented in a coal seam~and (2) how to determine the frequency of their connectivites. The new available and presented techniques to answer these questions have a strong computer based tool (geographic information system, GIS), able to build a complete georeferentiated database, which will allow to three-dimensionally locate the laboratory samples in the coalfield. It will also allow to better understand the coal cleat system and consequently to recognize the best pathways to gas flow through the coal seam. Such knowledge is considered crucial for understanding what is likely to be the most efficient opening of cleat network, then allowing the injection with the right spatial orientation, of pressurized fluids in order to directly drain the maximum amount of gas flow to a CBM exploitation well. The method is also applicable to the CO2 geological sequestration technologies and operations corresponding to the injection of CO2 sequestered from industrial plants in coal seams of abandoned coal mines or deep coal seams.},

	abstract = {Cleats are natural opening-mode fractures in coal beds. They account for most of the permeability and much of the porosity of coalbed gas reservoirs and can have a significant effect on the success of engineering procedures such as cavity stimulations. Because permeability and stimulation success are commonly limiting factors in gas well performance, knowledge of cleat characteristics and origins is essential for successful exploration and production. Although the coal{\textendash}cleat literature spans at least 160 years, mining issues have been the principal focus, and quantitative data are almost exclusively limited to orientation and spacing information. Few data are available on apertures, heights, lengths, connectivity, and the relation of cleat formation to diagenesis, characteristics that are critical to permeability. Moreover, recent studies of cleat orientation patterns and fracture style suggest that new investigations of even these well-studied parameters can yield insight into coal permeability. More effective predictions of cleat patterns will come from advances in understanding cleat origins. Although cleat formation has been speculatively attributed to diagenetic and/or tectonic processes, a viable mechanical process for creating cleats has yet to be demonstrated. Progress in this area may come from recent developments in fracture mechanics and in coal geochemistry.},

Multivariate Density Estimation: Theory, Practice, and Visualization demonstrates that density estimation retains its explicative power even when applied to trivariate and quadrivariate data. By presenting the major ideas in the context of the classical histogram, the text simplifies the understanding of advanced estimators and develops links between the intuitive histogram and other methods that are more statistically efficient. The theoretical results covered are those particularly relevant to application and understanding. The focus is on methodology, new ideas, and practical advice. A hierarchical approach draws attention to the similarities among different estimators. Also, detailed discussions of nonparametric dimension reduction, nonparametric regression, additive modeling, and classification are included. Because visualization is a key element in effective multivariate nonparametric analysis, more than 100 graphic illustrations supplement the numerous problems and examples presented in the text. In addition, sixteen four-color plates help to convey an intuitive feel for both the theory and practice of density estimation in several dimensions. Ideal as an introductory textbook, Multivariate Density Estimation is also an indispensable professional reference for statisticians, biostatisticians, electrical engineers, econometricians, and other scientistsinvolved in data analysis.},

Copulas have recently attracted much attention in spatial statistics and are used as a flexible alternative to traditional methods for non-Gaussian spatial modeling and interpolation. We adopt this methodology and show how it can be incorporated in a Bayesian framework by assigning priors to all model parameters. In the absence of simple analytical expressions for the joint posterior distribution we propose a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm to obtain posterior samples. The posterior predictive density is approximated by averaging the plug-in predictive densities. Furthermore, we discuss the deficiencies of the existing spatial copula models with regard to modeling extreme events. It is shown that the non-Gaussian χ 2 -copula model suffers from the same lack of tail dependence as the Gaussian copula and thus offers no advantage over the latter with respect to modeling extremes.

We present three methods for performing spatial interpolation using copulas. By exploiting the relationship between bivariate copulas and indicator covariances, the first method performs indicator kriging and disjunctive kriging. As a second method we propose a simple kriging of the rank-transformed data. The third method is a plug-in Bayes predictor, where the predictive distribution is calculated using the conditional copula given the observed data and the model parameters. We show that the latter approach generalizes the frequently applied trans-Gaussian kriging.

Using copulas, the dependence of multivariate distributions is modelled by the joint cumulative distribution of the variables using uniform marginal distribution functions. The uniform marginal distributions are the effect of transforming the marginal distributions monotonically by using the ranks of the variables. Due to the uniform marginal distributions, copulas express the dependence structure of the variables independent of the variables’ marginal distributions which means that copulas display interdependence between variables in its purest form. This property also means that marginal distributions of the original data have no influence on the spatial dependence structure and can not “cover up” parts of the spatial dependence structure. Additionally, differences in the degree of dependence between different quantiles of the variables are readily identified by the shape of the contours of an empirical copula density. Regarding the quantification of uncertainties, copulas offer a significant advantage: the full distribution function of the interpolated parameter at every interpolation point is available. The magnitude of uncertainty does not depend on the density of the observation network only, but also on the magnitude of the measurements as well as on the gradient of the magnitude of the measurements. That means for the same configuration of the observation network, interpolating two events with very similar marginal distribution, the confidence intervals look significantly different for both events.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis paper presents an innovative integrated workflow applied to the characterization of a carbonate fractured reservoir in order to generate an effective 3D Matrix Block Size (MBS) distribution based on all available data: geological, geophysical and dynamic production data. The MBS is a key factor determining heating and thereby recovery efficiency during steam flooding in a fractured reservoir. The MBS model allows simulating the complex flow and establishing reservoir management strategies that will optimize oil recovery and facility sizing.The major difficulty in developing a 3D MBS model is the ability to account for the all the information pertinent to natural fractures in the field and develop an understanding of what geological characteristics are linked to the occurrence of fractures. Until recently most fractured reservoir modeling tools were limited to simple discrete statistical models. A new approach in fractured reservoir characterization, using primarily artificial intelligence tools, is presented in this paper. The methodology is based on the assumption that there is a complex relationship between a large number of potential geologic drivers (structure, faults, matrix characteristics etc.) and fractures. The combination of both the continuum fracture modeling (CFM) and discrete fracture network (DFN) modeling provides a quantitative framework for MBS distribution estimation, geological concepts and data integration. The application of this integrated workflow to the Qarn Alam field is presented in this paper.IntroductionThe Qarn Alam Field of Central Oman contains an estimated STOIIP of 185 million m3 of heavy oil, which is planned to be developed with a full-field steam injection EOR project. Despite the fact that the oil production from the main reservoir, the Shuaiba, is known to occur via a fracture/karst network, the vast majority of the oil is stored in the matrix. The porosity and permeability network of the matrix is often a function of the distribution of depositional rock facies. If significantly different facies are present in a reservoir, their spatial arrangement has to be understood and modeled adequately, in order to understand hydrocarbon distribution and recovery. Critical for the success of a full field steam injection EOR project is a proper understanding of the subsurface geology, most importantly the distribution of matrix porosity and permeability and the occurrence and distribution of hydraulically conductive fractures. This paper illustrates the combination of CFM and DFN modeling to model the fracture distribution and the MBS distribution.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe recent years have seen the emergence of detailed field data acquisition and efficient modelling tools to characterize reservoirs and model their complex internal structure in a realistic way. This progress led to the detection of multi-scale fractures in most reservoirs, and enabled to interpret unexpected field production features such as early breakthroughs. Therefore, the availability of a workflow and an integrated modelling methodology becomes more and more crucial to take into account the geological information about fractures/faults into the reservoir dynamic simulation process for optimizing field productivity and reserves. This paper reviews and illustrates the overall methodology and the specifically-involved procedures and tools we have gradually built from the experience acquired in various fractured field case studies.The main steps of this multidisciplinary approach include (a) the detection, geological analysis and modeling of multiscale natural fracture network from seismic and well data, (b) its validation and calibration from dynamic field information such as well tests, (c) the choice of an equivalent simulation model applicable at reservoir scale, and its construction thanks to innovative flow up-scaling procedures applied to the realistic model provided by the geologist, (d) the implementation of predictive and numerically-efficient algorithms to represent the physics of flow transfers occurring both at local and large scale during multiphase field production.Thanks to this consistent workflow, field simulation models remain interpretable in geological terms, which is helpful for subsequent model updating. Thus, specialists in geosciences and reservoir engineers can cooperate in a very effective way to improve the management of fractured reservoirs.IntroductionThe presence of fractures and faults in petroleum reservoirs has always been an issue for the assessment of field productivity and reserves. The internal structure and flow behaviour of fractured reservoirs1,2,3 has been fairly well understood for a long time however, until recently, no consistent methodology and software enabled to integrate field information about natural fracturing for field production purposes. The recent development of new field data acquisition techniques, such as borehole imaging and 3D seismic, was an incentive for such integration. The unexpected production behaviour of many fields4 arising from an insufficient consideration of fracture effects on flow emphasized the need for better characterizing the distribution of fractures at various scales and transferring the meaningful part of this information to field simulation models.Taking into account the availability of fracture-related information and flow simulation issues, we developed an integrated methodology involving the following steps (Fig. 1):- constrained modelling of the geological fracture network based on the analysis, interpolation and extrapolation of fracture information acquired in wells and seismic surveys, sometime completed by outcrop analogue data;- characterizating the hydrodynamic properties of this natural network from flow-related data; - choosing a flow simulation model suited to the role played by fractures and faults at various scales and involving upscaled parameters derived from the flow-calibrated geological fracture model;- simulating reservoir flow behaviour on the basis of a physical assessment of multiphase flow mechanisms prevailing in transfers within and between media.Using terminology found in the literature,5 the first two steps of this methodology combine a forward approach mainly based on geosciences and an inverse approach based on reservoir engineering. The flow upscaling procedures involved in the last two steps ensure consistency between the flow-calibrated geological model and the single-medium, multi-medium and/or explicit modelling approach(es) chosen for field simulation. The four steps of this integrated approach are presented, discussed and illustrated hereafter.Building a geological model of faults and fractures.The methodology is extensively described by Cacas et al.6 and is briefly summarized hereafter (Fig. 2).},

	abstract = {Groundwater quality parameters exhibit considerable spatial variability. Geostatistical methods including the assessment of variograms are usually used to characterize this variability. Copulas offer an interesting opportunity to describe dependence structures for multivariate distributions. Bivariate empirical copulas can be used as an alternative to variograms and covariance functions for the description of the spatial variability. Rank correlations of these copulas express the strength of the dependence independently of the marginal distributions and thus offer an alternative to the variograms. Empirical copulas for four quality parameters, chloride, sulfate, pH, and nitrate, obtained from a large-scale groundwater quality measurement network in Baden-W\"{u}rttemberg (Germany) are calculated. They indicate that the spatial dependence structure of the investigated parameters is not Gaussian. Two theoretical copula-based models are presented in this paper: a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian. Bootstrap-based statistical tests using stochastic simulation of the multivariate distributions are used to investigate the appropriateness of the models. According to the test results the Gaussian copula is rejected for most of the parameters while the non-Gaussian alternative is not rejected in most cases.},

	abstract = {In many naturally fractured reservoirs, fractures play a crucial role in their flow and transport properties. An approach that has recently gained popularity for modeling fracture systems is the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model. This approach consists in applying a stochastic boolean simulation method, also known as object simulation method, where fractures are represented as simplified geometric objects (line segments in 2D and polygons in 3D). One of the shortcomings of this approach is that it usually does not consider the dependence relationships that may exist between geometric properties of fractures (direction, length, aperture), that is, each property is simulated independently. In this work a method for modeling such dependencies by copula theory is introduced. In particular, a nonparametric model using Bernstein copulas for direction-length fracture dependency in 2D is presented. The application of this method is illustrated in an example which shows high agreement between data and simulation, both graphically and in its descriptive statistics, both marginally and jointly, and in the DFN as a whole.},

Correlation, typically in terms of Pearson\92s correlation coefficient, is a measure of association between two linear random variables x and y. In this paper, the specific circular technique of the parametric and nonparametric linear-circular correlation coefficient will be explored where correlation is no longer between two linear variables x and y, but between a linear random variable x and circular random variable ?.

A simulation study of the parametric and nonparametric Linear-Circular Correlation Coefficient was carried out to evaluate the mathematical distribution the statistics followed. A further study was conducted to investigate the effect of ties on the nonparametric correlation coefficient. Lastly, a comparison of power between the parametric and nonparametric Linear-Circular Correlation coefficient was conducted with varying sample sizes, means, and distributions.

It was found that the nonparametric and parametric test statistics both follow their theoretical distributions (asymptotically for the nonparametric statistic). It was found that the nonparametric statistic was robust against ties. Additionally, it was also found that the power of the parametric statistic outperformed the nonparametric statistic for almost all values of ? for our exponential linear random variable},

The bias in Bayesian estimation is also considered, although the illustrative examples are all for the case of a uniform prior, i.e. the estimation is maximum likelihood. In the most important of the subsidiary results, a generalized ratio of the bias to the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter estimates is defined, and shown to be closely related to Beale's (1960) measures of nonlinearity. Finally the philosophy is applied to a somewhat different problem, namely determining the biases in the maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of the gamma distribution.},

	abstract = {Fracture mechanics modelling of fracture pattern development was used to analyse pattern geometry and population statistics for natural opening-mode fractures. Orthogonal fracture network geometries were generated under biaxial extension loading conditions from a slightly anisotropic initial strain state. Fracture statistics were analysed by grouping all fracture orientations into one population for these unique orthogonal pattern geometries. Fracture aperture distributions resembled negative exponential curve shapes, consistent with published observations for stratabound fractures in sedimentary rock. Fracture length distributions had a strongly power-law shape, and showed that longer fractures grew first and reached their fullest extent before shorter fractures began propagating. The power-law shape of the length distribution was first established by the growth of the longest fractures in the population, followed by the later growth of shorter fractures that extended the power-law shape to smaller sizes. The shortest fracture length at which the power-law distribution was truncated varied with the magnitude of the applied strain. Other variations in fracture pattern results were tied to mechanical layer thickness and subcritical crack growth propagation properties of the fractured media.},

abstract ={Because of the multiscaled character of fracture networks and their high degree of heterogeneity, characterization and modelling of fractured reservoirs requires different techniques to the well-established geostatistical methods derived for modelling rock heterogeneity. We have developed a method to improve the geological model used as an input of fractured reservoir fluid flow simulators, either in single or dual permeability simulations, as well as new specific procedures. The method is based on three nested models. The first, the ‘global geo-cellular fracture model’, considers fracture average property distribution at the scale of the reservoir. Location of the major faults as well as properties, such as horizon curvature, are taken into account. ‘The global discrete model’ considers the fault system at the same scale and algorithms generate realistic synthetic fault patterns using an object-orientated approach. The third model, the ‘local discrete model’, creates realistic synthetic fracture patterns at the decametre scale with another object-orientated procedure. These models are all constrained by hard data acquired from seismic, well imaging and logs. They can be constrained by output from deterministic approaches like structural evolution analyses and geomechanical modelling. Interrelationships between these models enable account to be taken of the complex interrelationships between fractures at different scales and rock material heterogeneity. Finally, this modelling approach makes the geological model used as an input of fractured reservoir fluid flow simulators more satisfying than conventional approaches.},

	abstract = {A root-finding algorithm is a numerical method, or algorithm, for finding a value x such that f(x) = 0, for a given function f. Such an x is called a root of the function f.
This article is concerned with finding scalar, real or complex roots, approximated as floating point numbers. Finding integer roots or exact algebraic roots are separate problems, whose algorithms have little in common with those discussed here. See Diophantine equation for integer roots.
Finding a root of f(x) − g(x) = 0 is the same as solving the equation f(x) = g(x). Here, x is called the unknown in the equation. Conversely, any equation can take the canonical form f(x) = 0, so equation solving is the same thing as computing (or finding) a root of a function.
Numerical root-finding methods use iteration, producing a sequence of numbers that hopefully converge towards the root as a limit. They require one or more initial guesses of the root as starting values, then each iteration of the algorithm produces a successively more accurate approximation to the root. Since the iteration must be stopped at some point these methods produce an approximation to the root, not an exact solution. Many methods compute subsequent values by evaluating an auxiliary function on the preceding values. The limit is thus a fixed point of the auxiliary function, which is chosen for having the roots of the original equation as fixed points.
The behaviour of root-finding algorithms is studied in numerical analysis. Algorithms perform best when they take advantage of known characteristics of the given function, so different algorithms are used to solve different types of equations. Desirable characteristics include a rapid rate of convergence, ability to separate close roots, robustness against failures of differentiability, and low propagation rate of rounding errors.},

Array programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data manipulation. The level of concision can be dramatic in certain cases: it is not uncommon to find array programming language one-liners that require more than a couple of pages of Java code.
Modern programming languages that support array programming are commonly used in scientific and engineering settings; these include Fortran 90, Mata, MATLAB, Analytica, TK Solver (as lists), Octave, R, Cilk Plus, Julia, and the NumPy extension to Python. In these languages, an operation that operates on entire arrays can be called a vectorized operation, regardless of whether it is executed on a vector processor or not.},

Association measures such as Kendall's tau or Spearman's rho can be expressed as functionals of the copula. The dependence structure between two variables can be highly influenced by a covariate, and it is of real interest to know how this dependence structure changes with the value taken by the covariate. This motivates the need for introducing conditional copulas, and the associated conditional Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho association measures. After the introduction and motivation of these concepts, two nonparametric estimators for a conditional copula are proposed and discussed. Then nonparametric estimates for the conditional association measures are derived. A key issue is that these measures are now looked at as functions in the covariate. The performances of all estimators are investigated via a simulation study which also includes a data-driven algorithm for choosing the smoothing parameters. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated on two real data examples.},

	abstract = {Assessment of rock formation permeability is a complicated and challenging problem that plays a key role in oil reservoir modeling, production forecast, and the optimal exploitation management. Generally, permeability evaluation is performed using porosity-permeability relationships obtained by integrated analysis of various petrophysical measurements taken from cores and wireline well logs. Dependence relationships between pairs of petrophysical variables, such as permeability and porosity, are usually nonlinear and complex, and therefore those statistical tools that rely on assumptions of linearity and/or normality and/or existence of moments are commonly not suitable in this case. But even expecting a single copula family to be able to model a complex bivariate dependency seems to be still too restrictive, at least for the petrophysical variables under consideration in this work. Therefore, we explore the use of the Bernstein copula, and we also look for an appropriate partition of the data into subsets for which the dependence strucure was simpler to model, and then a conditional gluing copula technique is applied to build the bivariate joint distribution for the whole data set.},

	url = {https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/58431},
	abstract = {In many natural fractured porous media, such as aquifers, soils, oil and geothermal reservoirs, fractures play a crucial role in their flow and transport properties. An approach that has recently gained popularity for modeling fracture systems is the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model. This approach consists in applying a stochastic boolean simulation method, also known as object simulation method, where fractures are represented as simplified geometric objects (line segments in 2D and polygons in 3D). One of the shortcomings of this approach is that it usually does not consider the dependency relationships that may exist between the geometric properties of fractures (direction, length, aperture, etc), that is, each property is simulated independently.

In this work a method for modeling such dependencies by copula theory is introduced. In particular, a nonparametric model using Bernstein copulas for direction-length fracture dependency in 2D is presented. The application of this method is illustrated in a case study for a fractured rock sample from a carbonate reservoir outcrop.},

	abstract = {In many earth sciences applications, the geological objects or structures to be reproduced are curvilinear, e.g., sand channels in a clastic reservoir. Their modeling requires multiple-point statistics involving jointly three or more points at a time, much beyond the traditional two-point variogram statistics. Actual data from the field being modeled, particularly if it is subsurface, are rarely enough to allow inference of such multiple-point statistics. The approach proposed in this paper consists of borrowing the required multiple-point statistics from training images depicting the expected patterns of geological heterogeneities. Several training images can be used, reflecting different scales of variability and styles of heterogeneities. The multiple-point statistics inferred from these training image(s) are exported to the geostatistical numerical model where they are anchored to the actual data, both hard and soft, in a sequential simulation mode. The algorithm and code developed are tested for the simulation of a fluvial hydrocarbon reservoir with meandering channels. The methodology proposed appears to be simple (multiple-point statistics are scanned directly from training images), general (any type of random geometry can be considered), and fast enough to handle large 3D simulation grids.},

In particular, we present a simple procedure to adapt Bernstein copulas to the circular framework and guarantee that the constructed bivariate distributions are strictly continuous.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a general nonparametric method for joint stochastic simulation of petrophysical properties using the Bernstein copula. This method consists basically in generating stochastic simulations of a given petrophysical property (primary variable) modeling the underlying empirical dependence with other petrophysical properties (secondary variables) while reproducing the spatial dependence of the first one.

This multivariate approach provides a very flexible tool to model the complex dependence relationships of petrophysical properties. It has several advantages over other traditional methods, since it is not restricted to the case of linear dependence among variables, it does not require the assumption of normality and/or existence of moments.

In this paper this method is applied to simulate rock permeability using Vugular Porosity and Shear Wave Velocity (S-Waves) as covariates in a carbonate double-porosity formation at well log scale. Simulated permeability values show a high degree of accuracy compared to the actual values.},

	abstract = {A technique is presented to determine when anisotropic fracture systems can be modeled as equivalent porous media (continua) for transport. In order to use the continuum approach, one must demonstrate that the fracture system has the same transport behavior as an equivalent porous medium. Hydraulic effective porosity is calculated as the product of specific discharge and mean travel time, divided by linear length of travel. Specific discharge and hydraulic effective porosity are measured in different directions of flow in regions of varying size with constant hydraulic gradients. If the fracture system behaves like an equivalent porous medium, directional flow has the following properties: (1) specific discharge can be predicted from a permeability tensor and (2) hydraulic effective porosity is independent of direction of flow. A numerical model has been developed to simulate mechanical transport under steady flow in a discrete fracture network. The model is used to determine the distribution of travel times from inlet to outlet for fluid traveling in stream tubes. We have examined only systems with parallel fracture sets in which all fractures are long compared to the region under study. These systems satisfy criterion 1 in that flux can be calculated using a porous medium equivalent. However, these systems do not satisfy criterion 2 because hydraulic effective porosity is shown to be directionally dependent. Thus, even though flux can be accurately predicted using porous medium assumptions for some fracture systems, it may not be possible to accurately predict mechanical transport using these same assumptions.},

	abstract = {The permeability of random two-dimensional Poisson fracture networks can be studied using a model based on percolation theory and equivalent media theory. Such theories are usually applied on regular lattices where the lattice elements are present with probability p. In order to apply these theories to random systems, we (1) define the equivalent to the case where p = 1, (2) define p in terms of the statistical parameters of the random network, and (3) define the equivalent of the coordination number z. An upper bound for permeability equivalent to the case of p = 1 is found by calculating the permeability of the fracture network with the same linear fracture frequency and infinitely long fractures. The permeability of networks with the same linear fracture frequency and finite fractures can be normalized by this maximum. An equivalent for p is found as a function of the connectivity $\zeta$, which is defined as the average number of intersections per fracture. This number can be calculated from the fracture density and distributions of fracture length and orientation. Then the equivalent p is defined by equating the average run length for a random network as a function of $\zeta$ to the average run length for a lattice as a function of p. The average run length in a random system is the average number of segments that a fracture is divided into by intersections with other fractures. In a lattice, it is the average number of bonds contiguous to a given bond. Also, an average coordination number can be calculated for the random systems as a function of $\zeta$. Given these definitions of p and z, expressions for permeability are found based on percolation theory and equivalent media theory on regular lattices. When the expression for p is used to calculate the correlation length from percolation theory, an empirical formula for the size of the REV can be developed. To apply the models to random length systems, the expression for $\zeta$ must be modified to remove short fractures which do not contribute to flow. This leads to a quantitative prediction of how permeability decreases as one removes shorter fractures from a network. Numerical studies provide strong support for these models. These results also apply to the analogous electrical conduction problem.},

A new approach, based on pluriGaussian structural simulation, is then introduced. The new approach incorporates in the simulation the spatial correlation between different sets of fractures, which in general, is very difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish in the three methods reviewed. Each simulation method is summarised together with detailed simulation procedures for each. A published two-dimensional fracture dataset is used as a means of assessing the performance of each simulation method and of demonstrating the concepts discussed in the text.},

	abstract = {"This book gives a comprehensive introduction to numerical methods and analysis of stochastic processes, random fields and stochastic differential equations, and offers graduate students and researchers powerful tools for understanding uncertainty quantification for risk analysis. Coverage includes traditional stochastic ODEs with white noise forcing, strong and weak approximation, and the multi-level Monte Carlo method. Later chapters apply the theory of random fields to the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs with correlated random data, discuss the Monte Carlo method, and introduce stochastic Galerkin finite-element methods. Finally, stochastic parabolic PDEs are developed. Assuming little previous exposure to probability and statistics, theory is developed in tandem with state-of the art computational methods through worked examples, exercises, theorems and proofs. The set of MATLAB codes included (and downloadable) allows readers to perform computations themselves and solve the test problems discussed. Practical examples are drawn from finance, mathematical biology, neuroscience, fluid flow modeling and materials science"--},

	abstract = {Many phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology can be modeled by spatial random processes. One such process is continuum percolation, which is used when the phenomenon being modeled is made up of individual events that overlap e.g., individual raindrops that eventually make the ground evenly wet. This is a systematic, rigorous account of continuum percolation. The authors treat two models, the Boolean model and the random connection model, in detail, and they discuss related continuum models. Meester and Roy explain all important techniques and methods and apply them to obtain results on the existence of phase transitions, equality and continuity of critical densities, compressions, rarefaction, and other aspects of continuum models.},

	isbn = {978-3-662-03981-6},
	url = {http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=3098573},
	abstract = {Percolation theory is the study of an idealized random medium in two or more dimensions. It is a cornerstone of the theory of spatial stochastic processes with applications in such fields as statistical physics, epidemiology, and the spread of populations. Percolation plays a pivotal role in studying more complex systems exhibiting phase transition. The mathematical theory is mature, but continues to give rise to problems of special beauty and difficulty. The emphasis of this book is upon core mathematical material and the presentation of the shortest and most accessible proofs. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers in probability and mathematical physics. Almost no specialist knowledge is assumed beyond undergraduate analysis and probability. This new volume differs substantially from the first edition through the inclusion of much new material, including: the rigorous theory of dynamic and static renormalization; a sketch of the lace expansion and mean field theory; the uniqueness of the infinite cluster; strict inequalities between critical probabilities; several essays on related fields and applications; numerous other results of significant. There is a summary of the hypotheses of conformal invariance. A principal feature of the process is the phase transition. The subcritical and supercritical phases are studied in detail. There is a guide for mathematicians to the physical theory of scaling and critical exponents, together with selected material describing the current state of the rigorous theory. To derive a rigorous theory of the phase transition remains an outstanding and beautiful problem of mathematics.},
